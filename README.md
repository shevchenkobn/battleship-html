### TODO

#### Basic version:
- implement board (with islands, each player has own), ship positioning (not straight) in an extensible way (1d array-like); make ability to continue shooting easy to implement.
- ask about leaving if game started.
- 10x10 board;
- ships: carrier 5x1, battleship 4x1, cruiser 3x2, destroyer 2x1;
- shoot without continuation;
- localisation (ua & uk);
- tests (unit & react, selected functionality);
- user name & password (for checking your board in game, optional);
- scoreboard (localstorage);
- simple AI (no heuristics);

#### Improvements:
- continue shooting after hit;
- 5x5 board (names: drill & skirmish);
- custom board with islands, same amount of water (name: terraforming);
- network scoreboard?;
- game export (encrypt using password);
- combine stuff in settings;
